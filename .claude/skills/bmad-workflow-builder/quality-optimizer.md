# Quality Optimizer

Communicate with user in `{communication_language}`. Write report content in `{document_output_language}`.

You orchestrate quality scans on a BMad workflow or skill. Deterministic checks run as scripts (fast, zero tokens). Judgment-based analysis runs as LLM subagents. You synthesize all results into a unified report.

## Your Role: Coordination, Not File Reading

**DO NOT read the target skill's files yourself.** Scripts and subagents do all analysis.

Your job:
1. Create output directory
2. Run all lint scripts + pre-pass scripts (instant, deterministic)
3. Spawn all LLM scanner subagents in parallel (with pre-pass data where available)
4. Collect all results
5. Synthesize into unified report (spawn report creator)
6. Present findings to user

## Autonomous Mode

**Check if `{headless_mode}=true`** — If set, run in headless mode:
- **Skip ALL questions** — proceed with safe defaults
- **Uncommitted changes:** Note in report, don't ask
- **Workflow functioning:** Assume yes, note in report that user should verify
- **After report:** Output summary and exit, don't offer next steps
- **Output format:** Structured JSON summary + report path, minimal conversational text

**Autonomous mode output:**
```json
{
  "headless_mode": true,
  "report_file": "{path-to-report}",
  "summary": { ... },
  "warnings": ["Uncommitted changes detected", "Workflow functioning not verified"]
}
```

## Pre-Scan Checks

Before running any scans:

**IF `{headless_mode}=true`:**
1. **Check for uncommitted changes** — Run `git status`. Note in warnings array if found.
2. **Skip workflow functioning verification** — Add to warnings: "Workflow functioning not verified — user should confirm workflow is working before applying fixes"
3. **Proceed directly to scans**

**IF `{headless_mode}=false` or not set:**
1. **Check for uncommitted changes** — Run `git status` on the repository. If uncommitted changes:
   - Warn: "You have uncommitted changes. It's recommended to commit before optimization so you can easily revert if needed."
   - Ask: "Do you want to proceed anyway, or commit first?"
   - Halt and wait for user response

2. **Verify workflow is functioning** — Ask if the workflow is currently working as expected. Optimization should improve, not break working workflows.

## Communicate This Guidance to the User

**Workflow skills are both art and science.** The optimization report will contain many suggestions, but use your judgment:

- Reports may suggest leaner phrasing — but if the current phrasing captures the right guidance, keep it
- Reports may say content is "unnecessary" — but if it adds clarity, it may be worth keeping
- Reports may suggest scripting vs. prompting — consider what works best for the use case

**Over-optimization warning:** Optimizing too aggressively can make workflows lose their effectiveness. Apply human judgment alongside the report's suggestions.

## Quality Scanners

### Lint Scripts (Deterministic — Run First)

These run instantly, cost zero tokens, and produce structured JSON:

| # | Script | Focus | Temp Filename |
|---|--------|-------|---------------|
| S1 | `scripts/scan-path-standards.py` | Path conventions: {project-root} only for _bmad, bare _bmad, double-prefix, absolute paths | `path-standards-temp.json` |
| S2 | `scripts/scan-scripts.py` | Script portability, PEP 723, agentic design, unit tests | `scripts-temp.json` |

### Pre-Pass Scripts (Feed LLM Scanners)

These extract metrics for the LLM scanners so they work from compact data instead of raw files:

| # | Script | Feeds | Temp Filename |
|---|--------|-------|---------------|
| P1 | `scripts/prepass-workflow-integrity.py` | workflow-integrity LLM scanner | `workflow-integrity-prepass.json` |
| P2 | `scripts/prepass-prompt-metrics.py` | prompt-craft LLM scanner | `prompt-metrics-prepass.json` |
| P3 | `scripts/prepass-execution-deps.py` | execution-efficiency LLM scanner | `execution-deps-prepass.json` |

### LLM Scanners (Judgment-Based — Run After Scripts)

| # | Scanner | Focus | Pre-Pass? | Temp Filename |
|---|---------|-------|-----------|---------------|
| L1 | `quality-scan-workflow-integrity.md` | Logical consistency, description quality, progression condition quality, type-appropriate structure | Yes — receives prepass JSON | `workflow-integrity-temp.json` |
| L2 | `quality-scan-prompt-craft.md` | Token efficiency, anti-patterns, outcome balance, Overview quality, progressive disclosure | Yes — receives metrics JSON | `prompt-craft-temp.json` |
| L3 | `quality-scan-execution-efficiency.md` | Parallelization, subagent delegation, read avoidance, context optimization | Yes — receives dep graph JSON | `execution-efficiency-temp.json` |
| L4 | `quality-scan-skill-cohesion.md` | Stage flow coherence, purpose alignment, complexity appropriateness | No | `skill-cohesion-temp.json` |
| L5 | `quality-scan-enhancement-opportunities.md` | Creative edge-case discovery, experience gaps, delight opportunities, assumption auditing | No | `enhancement-opportunities-temp.json` |
| L6 | `quality-scan-script-opportunities.md` | Deterministic operation detection — finds LLM work that should be scripts instead | No | `script-opportunities-temp.json` |

## Execution Instructions

First create output directory: `{bmad_builder_reports}/{skill-name}/quality-scan/{date-time-stamp}/`

### Step 1: Run Lint Scripts (Parallel)

Run all applicable lint scripts in parallel. They output JSON to stdout — capture to temp files in the output directory:

```bash
# Full scan runs all 2 lint scripts + all 3 pre-pass scripts (5 total, all parallel)
python3 scripts/scan-path-standards.py {skill-path} -o {quality-report-dir}/path-standards-temp.json
python3 scripts/scan-scripts.py {skill-path} -o {quality-report-dir}/scripts-temp.json
uv run scripts/prepass-workflow-integrity.py {skill-path} -o {quality-report-dir}/workflow-integrity-prepass.json
python3 scripts/prepass-prompt-metrics.py {skill-path} -o {quality-report-dir}/prompt-metrics-prepass.json
uv run scripts/prepass-execution-deps.py {skill-path} -o {quality-report-dir}/execution-deps-prepass.json
```

### Step 2: Spawn LLM Scanners (Parallel)

After scripts complete, spawn applicable LLM scanners as parallel subagents.

**For scanners WITH pre-pass (L1, L2, L3):** provide the pre-pass JSON file path so the scanner reads compact metrics instead of raw files. The subagent should read the pre-pass JSON first, then only read raw files for judgment calls the pre-pass doesn't cover.

**For scanners WITHOUT pre-pass (L4, L5, L6):** provide just the skill path and output directory as before.

Each subagent receives:
- Scanner file to load (e.g., `quality-scan-skill-cohesion.md`)
- Skill path to scan: `{skill-path}`
- Output directory for results: `{quality-report-dir}`
- Temp filename for output: `{temp-filename}`
- Pre-pass file path (if applicable): `{quality-report-dir}/{prepass-filename}`

The subagent will:
- Load the scanner file and operate as that scanner
- Read pre-pass JSON first if provided, then read raw files only as needed
- Output findings as detailed JSON to: `{quality-report-dir}/{temp-filename}.json`
- Return only the filename when complete

## Synthesis

After all scripts and scanners complete:

**IF only lint scripts ran (no LLM scanners):**
1. Read the script output JSON files
2. Present findings directly — these are definitive pass/fail results

**IF single LLM scanner (with or without scripts):**
1. Read all temp JSON files (script + scanner)
2. Present findings directly in simplified format
3. Skip report creator (not needed for single scanner)

**IF multiple LLM scanners:**
1. Initiate a subagent with `report-quality-scan-creator.md`

**Provide the subagent with:**
- `{skill-path}` — The skill being validated
- `{temp-files-dir}` — Directory containing all `*-temp.json` files (both script and LLM results)
- `{quality-report-dir}` — Where to write the final report

## Generate HTML Report

After the report creator finishes (or after presenting lint-only / single-scanner results), generate the interactive HTML report:

```bash
python3 scripts/generate-html-report.py {quality-report-dir} --open
```

This produces `{quality-report-dir}/quality-report.html` — a self-contained interactive report with severity filters, collapsible sections, per-item copy-prompt buttons, and a batch prompt generator. The `--open` flag opens it in the default browser.

## Present Findings to User

After receiving the JSON summary from the report creator:

**IF `{headless_mode}=true`:**
1. **Output structured JSON:**
```json
{
  "headless_mode": true,
  "scan_completed": true,
  "report_file": "{full-path-to-report}",
  "html_report": "{full-path-to-html}",
  "warnings": ["any warnings from pre-scan checks"],
  "summary": {
    "total_issues": 0,
    "critical": 0,
    "high": 0,
    "medium": 0,
    "low": 0,
    "overall_quality": "{Excellent|Good|Fair|Poor}",
    "truly_broken_found": false
  }
}
```
2. **Exit** — Don't offer next steps, don't ask questions

**IF `{headless_mode}=false` or not set:**
1. **High-level summary** with total issues by severity
2. **Highlight truly broken/missing** — CRITICAL and HIGH issues prominently
3. **Mention reports** — "Full report: {report_file}" and "Interactive HTML report opened in browser (also at: {html_report})"
4. **Offer next steps:**
   - Apply fixes directly
   - Use the HTML report to select specific items and generate prompts
   - Discuss specific findings

## Key Principle

Your role is ORCHESTRATION: run scripts, spawn subagents, synthesize results. Scripts handle deterministic checks (paths, schema, script standards). LLM scanners handle judgment calls (cohesion, craft, efficiency). You coordinate both and present unified findings.
