## Strengths

*What this agent does well — preserve these during optimization:*

<!-- Collect from ALL of these sources:
  - All scanners: findings[] with severity="strength" or category="strength"
  - prompt-craft: findings where severity="note" and observation is positive
  - prompt-craft: positive aspects from assessments.skillmd_assessment.notes and persona_context assessment
  - enhancement-opportunities: bright_spots from each assessments.user_journeys[] entry
  - structure: positive observations from assessments.metadata (e.g., memory setup present, headless mode configured)
  Group by theme. Each strength should explain WHY it matters. -->
