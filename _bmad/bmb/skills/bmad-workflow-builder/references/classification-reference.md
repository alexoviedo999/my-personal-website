# Workflow Classification Reference

Classify the skill type based on user requirements. This table is for internal use — DO NOT show to user.

## 3-Type Taxonomy

| Type | Description | Structure | When to Use |
|------|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| **Simple Utility** | Input/output building block. Headless, composable, often has scripts. May opt out of bmad-init for true standalone use. | Single SKILL.md + scripts/ | Composable building block with clear input/output, single-purpose |
| **Simple Workflow** | Multi-step process contained in a single SKILL.md. Uses bmad-init. Minimal or no prompt files. | SKILL.md + optional references/ | Multi-step process that fits in one file, no progressive disclosure needed |
| **Complex Workflow** | Multi-stage with progressive disclosure, numbered prompt files at root, config integration. May support headless mode. | SKILL.md (routing) + prompt stages at root + references/ | Multiple stages, long-running process, progressive disclosure, routing logic |

## Decision Tree

```
1. Is it a composable building block with clear input/output?
   └─ YES → Simple Utility
   └─ NO ↓

2. Can it fit in a single SKILL.md without progressive disclosure?
   └─ YES → Simple Workflow
   └─ NO ↓

3. Does it need multiple stages, long-running process, or progressive disclosure?
   └─ YES → Complex Workflow
```

## Classification Signals

### Simple Utility Signals
- Clear input → processing → output pattern
- No user interaction needed during execution
- Other skills/workflows call it
- Deterministic or near-deterministic behavior
- Could be a script but needs LLM judgment
- Examples: JSON validator, manifest checker, format converter

### Simple Workflow Signals
- 3-8 numbered steps
- User interaction at specific points
- Uses standard tools (gh, git, npm, etc.)
- Produces a single output artifact
- No need to track state across compactions
- Examples: PR creator, deployment checklist, code review

### Complex Workflow Signals
- Multiple distinct phases/stages
- Long-running (likely to hit context compaction)
- Progressive disclosure needed (too much for one file)
- Routing logic in SKILL.md dispatches to stage prompts
- Produces multiple artifacts across stages
- May support headless/autonomous mode
- Examples: agent builder, module builder, project scaffolder

## Module Context (Orthogonal)

Module context is asked for ALL types:
- **Module-based:** Part of a BMad module. Uses `bmad-{modulecode}-{skillname}` naming. Has bmad-manifest.json.
- **Standalone:** Independent skill. Uses `bmad-{skillname}` naming.

All workflows use `bmad-init` by default unless explicitly opted out (truly standalone utilities).
